# Eat-Da-Burger

<h2>Description</h2>

<p> Eat-Da-Burger is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name as available, the app will display the burger on the left. When the user selects Devoured, the burger moves to the right and is all gone. This app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.</p>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>

<h2>Roadmap</h2>
<p>In the future, I would like to spend more time styling this application. Also, pushing the application to Heroku with a MySQL database was challenging for me. I would like to become more comfortable with this in the future.
